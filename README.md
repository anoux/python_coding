Basic Python course and exercises.

Key Concepts

Constant = a fixed value such as numbers, letters and strings

Reserved words = those you can not use as identifiers (varaible names) for constants

Variable = a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the varaible name (identifier) 
Rules for varaibles names: only start with letter or underscore and they are case sensitive
